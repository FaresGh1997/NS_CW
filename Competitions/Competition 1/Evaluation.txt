
Evaluation Criteria
Your total score is calculated as weighted sum of 6 scores — similarities between statistics of original and generated networks. Each score takes values from the interval [0, 1], where 1 — absolute similarity with the original network. The scores are

    "KS"
        1 - KS_dist
        where KS_dist is Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between degree distributions of real and generated networks
    "Radius"
        where GK is Gaussian Kernel, r is a radius of a gigantic connected component (GCC) of the original network, r' is a radius of a generated network, sigma_r is a sigma of a radius from stats.txt file
    "Diameter" (GCC), "Av. clustering", "Av. path length" (GCC), "Number of CC" are calculated by Gaussian Kernel in the same way.
    "Total"
        1/6 * KS + 1/6 * Radius + 1/6 * Diameter + 1/6 * Av. clustering + 1/6 * Av. path length + 1/6 * Number of CC

All scores immediately take value 0 if a generated network has incorrect number of nodes. All scores are multiplied by 100 on the leaderboard.

Baselines
Baselines are calculated by the following algorithm:

    Generate a random degree sequence using Inverse Transform Sampling
    Generate a valid graph by Configuration Model
    Calculate total score
    Repeat 1-3 steps 1000 times and accumulate a set of total scores

Baseline for grade 4: beat a mean total score
Baseline for grade 6: beat a mean + 3*sigma total score

Calculated baselines are in the leaderboard.
