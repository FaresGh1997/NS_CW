
Challenge Overview
Your goal is to generate an undirected network that is as close as possible to the original real network. You do not have the original network in the explicit view, but you know some of its statistics. All statistics are in stats.txt file that contains a dictionary of the form

    number_nodes (number of nodes): value
    number_cc (number of connected components): value, sigma
    radius (radius of giant component): value, sigma
    diameter (diameter of giant component): value, sigma
    average_clustering (average clustering coefficient): value, sigma
    average_path_length (average path length): value, sigma
    degree_cdf (empirical CDF of degree distribution): values, probabilities

Meaning of all these sigmas is described in Evaluation section. 

You can use this code to draw CDF

q_seq, p_seq = stats['degree_cdf']
plt.plot(
    np.append(np.repeat(q_seq, 2)[1:], q_seq[-1]), 
    np.repeat(p_seq, 2)
)
plt.show()
