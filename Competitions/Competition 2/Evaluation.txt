
Evaluation Criteria
On the leaderboard you will see three scores:

    Profit — calculated as "total amount of money at the end - initial budget". This is the main score.
    Accepted — the total number of accepted people at the end.
    Days — the total duration of your campaign.

Baselines

    Simultaneously sign 10 random contracts on the first day. Decrease the number of contracts if you do not have enough money
    Wait the end of the campaign and calculate your profit.
    Repeat 10000 times
