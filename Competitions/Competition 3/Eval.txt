
Here are balanced classes, so the usual accuracy metric is used:

    Accuracy = True predictions / All predictions


Baselines:

    Grade 4: Concatenate node features and train Gradient Boosting with negative sampling.
    Grade 6: Train GNN with negative sampling. GNN consists of encoder and decoder. Encoder is two-layer GCN that takes node features and returns node emebeddings. Decoder is two-layer MLP that takes hadamart product of node embeddings and predicts links.
